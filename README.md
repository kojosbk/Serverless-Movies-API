# Serverless-Movies-API
# Capstone Project: Serverless Movies API

This GitHub repository hosts the codebase for a Capstone Project focused on building a Serverless Movies API. The objective is to create an API utilizing serverless functions that facilitate the retrieval of movie information.

## Key Features

- Creation of cloud infrastructure using an SDK, necessitating components such as a NoSQL database, cloud storage, and serverless functions.
- Acquisition or generation of movie data to be stored in the cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Storage of movie cover images in cloud storage.
- Implementation of three functions:
  1. **GetMovies:** Retrieves a JSON list containing information about all movies stored in the database, including URLs for their cover images.
  2. **GetMoviesByYear:** Filters and returns a list of movies released in a specified year, with the year provided as input by the client.
  3. **(Optional) GetMovieSummary:** Provides a summary of a specified movie, potentially generated by AI.

## Data Model

The data model for movies follows the structure:

```json
{
    "title": "title of the movie",
    "releaseYear": "when the movie was released",
    "genre": "genre of the movie",
    "coverUrl": "url-to-image-in-cloud-storage"
}
